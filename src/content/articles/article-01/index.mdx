**Silent Disco Dance Party in the Garden**  
_Sunday, May 25, 2025 – 8 PM to 11 PM_

Join us for an unforgettable evening in the Furman Garden! Wireless headsets deliver three separate music channels so you can choose your vibe, whether it’s disco, funk, 80s/90s hip-hop and rap, or pop hits spanning every decade. DJ’s Mister Lama (Carlos Lama), ZiggaSun (Almond Zigmund), and Sits-a-Lot (Amy Kirwin) are back on deck to set the mood, getting you on your feet—or keeping you mesmerized if you prefer to watch.

Refreshments, including cocktails and snacks, are available for purchase at Louise & Howie’s Coffee Bar in the lobby.
