Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow functions to access variables from their outer scope. This article explains closures, their practical uses, and common pitfalls.

## What Are Closures?

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state.

```js
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
    console.log(`Outer Variable: ${outerVariable}`)
    console.log(`Inner Variable: ${innerVariable}`)
  }
}

const closureExample = outerFunction("I am from outerFunction")

// Calling the inner function with the closure
closureExample("I am from innerFunction")
```
